# Algorithmic Trading with Machine Learning

This project explores algorithmic trading using traditional strategies and machine learning models to predict market movements and execute trades. It combines statistical methods, financial indicators, and machine learning to build and evaluate trading strategies.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
    - Collected historical stock data (both hourly and daily) from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
      - Preprocessed the raw data to handle:
      - Missing values and inconsistencies.
      - Feature generation for technical indicators like SMA, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.
      - Normalization and scaling to prepare data for machine learning models.
    - Saved the processed data for backtesting and training machine learning models.

2. **Backtesting Framework**:
   - Tracks portfolio value, holdings, transaction costs, and slippage.
   - Simulates realistic trading scenarios over historical data.

3. **Implemented Trading Strategies**:
   - **SMA Crossover**:
     - Uses short- and long-term moving averages to identify trend-following opportunities.
   - **Mean Reversion**:
     - Utilizes Bollinger Bands to identify overbought/oversold conditions for reversal trades.
   - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
     - Momentum-based strategy leveraging MACD line and Signal line crossovers.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures risk-adjusted returns.
   - **CAGR**: Compound Annual Growth Rate of the portfolio.
   - **Max Drawdown**: Biggest peak-to-trough loss in portfolio value.
   - **Volatility**: Quantifies the variability in portfolio returns.

5. **Machine Learning Classifier**:
   - **Random Forest Classifier**:
     - Predicts buy/sell/hold signals based on engineered features like technical indicators.
   - Includes cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - Portfolio value over time with buy/sell markers.
   - Table showing key performance metrics.
